notes:
  - test the duplicated task name

tasks:

  -
    name: task
    task:

      -
        func: shell
        do:
          - echo "hello"

  -
    desc: |
      a anonymous/empty named task could be used for a place holder for developement
      so it is still treated as valid task, since there is no name, it will not be used and invoked as an entry point
    task:
      -
        func: shell
        do:
          - echo "i am a no name task"

  -
    name: task
    task:
      -
        func: shell
        do:
          - echo "world"
