  title: datakey as source
  head: |
    Previously when we render a dvar, we implicitly use all vars from global runtime scope, however sometimes we need to use a specific data object as the data source to render dvar.

    In this case, we showcase to render dvar value using data field as source rather the global var name space

  sections:

    - title: What's the difference
      content: |
        Please note the datakey tag is used and it is pointing to a variable named student. In this caes the reference of {{.school}} will locate the school from global runtime var: .student.school

        Without this tag, the reference of {{.school}} will try to locate a var name school from global runtime

        Please also note that the datakey could be a dynamic using var, this gives you a little extra programmingbility for dynamic routing when you combine with logical if tag
