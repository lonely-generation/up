goal:
  - to show that you can use empty do list
  - introduce a new funcname noop to do var/dvar conversion
  - in noop, you can also do reg/dereg var in dvar evaluation

tasks:

  -
    name: task
    task:
      -
        func: shell
        do: []

      -
        func: shell
        #this would be totally fine
        #this step could be served as skeleton work as DESIGN step
        #and leave the implementation in future to be filled in
        #you can add desc field to describe what to plan to implement

      -
        func: shell
        desc: |
          this would be totally fine too without shell commands
          this step could be served as a intermediate step to
          register a var into global var map, and it will be
          avaiable after the next step
        vars:
          a: aa
          b: bb
        dvars:
          - name: adebug
            value: "{{.a}}"
            flags: [vvvv,]

      -
        func: noop
        desc: |
          in noop, you can also do reg/dereg var in dvar evaluation
          the noop func name makes more sense then shell func
          if you really want to do var manipulation only
        vars:
          c: cc
          d: dd
        dvars:
          - name: cdebug
            value: "{{.c}}"
            flags: [vvvv,]
