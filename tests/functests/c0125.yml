  head: |
    Introduce a internal var: up_runtime_task_layer_number. It is used for a force exit or an conditional break. The typical usecase would be a business logic to attempt to maximize the possibility ub a recurisve maner in code execution to probe. For example, web page scraping and a implementation of web spider etc.
