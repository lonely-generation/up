    Showcase you can use if condition for cmd func and call func too

  sections:
    - title: What's good about it when you use if with call func?
      content: |
        The call func actually is very powerfully to create a execution branch with its own stack. So if you use a if condition to call another task, it actually separate the implementation with your own main flow.

        Also with multiple if, it is similar to convert the workflow to if/if else, or switch/case etc. Or with embeded if in callee, you could create branched flows so this enrichs the workflow management in very simple way compare to other tools

notes:
  goal:
    - test the if condition works for cmd and call

tasks:
  -
    name: task
    task:

      - func: call
        do:
          - taska
        if: "false"

      - func: cmd
        dvars:
          - name: greet
            value: hello
            flags: [vvvv]
        if: "true"

      - func: call
        do:
          - taska
        if: "true"

  - name: taska
    task:
      - func: shell
        desc: greet var will be no value as it is a local var for cmd step
        do:
          - echo "hello from taska"
          - echo "{{.greet}} from taska"
