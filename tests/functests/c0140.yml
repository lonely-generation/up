  title: public and protected tasks
  head: |
    It is a implicit rule that it is a public task if the task name start with a upper case letter, otherwise it is a protected task

    The intention is that public tasks is a callerable one from CLI command, which could have a chaine of depenent protected tasks for detailed implementations

    Also, for collaboration of different projects, it is a implicit rule that public task is more like a interface to be consumable and protected tasks are internal private business.

    There is no hard rule to forbid you to use protected tasks, it is just a mutual common contract to collaborate with each other in a clear standard
