    This showcases that you can use a set of local vars loaded from a file

  sections:
    - title: What's the use cae of this
      content: |
        There are a few benefits using vars loaded from a file

        1. segregate the context in local scope

        2. the vars externalized will be used to render the template, while they are usable in that local scope for all sub steps and sub cmd calls

        A typical use case would be the batch process in the loop to load its own vars set for that loop sub call. In this case, if you use varsfile to reder template, the vars will be cached in local, they can be used not only for templating, but also in all types of func calls

    - title: How does it work if you have the declared varss in that func at the same time
      content: |
        The vars from the var file will be the base, the vars declared in func will be take high priority to overwrite if it has defined in the file already.

        This example shows how it works

  - add support to load vars in func from file
  - refdir apply
