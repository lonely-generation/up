    Showcase you can use pause during the execution of the task steps

      content: |
        It is good that we can have an option to pause the workflow and inspect the runtime values to understand what is not working. You will be prompted with option to continue, to quit or inspect the runtime vars

        Note that pause support generic step rather than just shell func, it works for cmd func too in this demo

        ```
        Enter Value For pause action to continue:

        enter: continue
            q: quit
            i: inspect
        ```

  goal:
    - add pause
    - add pause support to generic step rather than just shell func

  -
    name: task

      - func: shell
        vars:
          b: runtime-var-b
        do:
          - echo "hello"
          - echo "hello {{.a}}"
        flags: [pause]

      - func: cmd
        vars:
          b: runtime-var-b
        do:
          - name: print
            cmd: "hello {{.a}}"
        flags: [pause]

      - func: shell
        do:
