goal:
  - to show complex object using dynamic var

design:
  - to make it simple, the dvar value is always a string
  - |
    the string could be a formated yaml, so that you can
    convert it to yaml then a object
  - register the object into that scope's vars list
  - consider a modified name of -> a_smart_guy_obj to reference to

vars:
  student:
    name: Tom
    gender: Male
    school: Sydney Grammar

dvars:
  - name: a_smart_guy
    value: |
      name: "{{.student.name}}"
      sex: "{{.student.gender}}"
      school: "{{.student.school}}"

tasks:

  - name: task
    task:
      -
        func: shell
        do:
          - echo """a smart guy=>{{.a_smart_guy}}"""
