  title: load from refdir
  head: |
    By default when you use ref tag to load dvar value from a file, it will use the default refdir from cli command line args, however this could be overriden using the refdir tag in dvar config

  sections:
    - title: how does it work?
      content: |
        By default the the refdir should be from below command line, its value will be: ./tests/functests

        ```
        up ngo -d ./tests/functests -t $1 -i dev -v vvvv --configdir=./tests/functests
        ```

        In this case, the refdir is overriden using your own customised location
