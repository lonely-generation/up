  title: load from refdir
  head: |
    By default when you use ref tag to load taskfrom a file, it will use the default refdir from cli command line args, however this could be overriden using the refdir tag in task configuration

  sections:
    - title: how does it work?
      content: |
        By default the the refdir should be from below command line, its value will be: ./tests/functests

        ```
        up ngo -d ./tests/functests -t $1 -i dev -v vvvv --configdir=./tests/functests
        ```

        In this case, the refdir is overriden using your own customised location

    - title: Relavant
      content: load dvar using refdir
      refs:
        - title: externalise dvar and use refdir
          link: ../../organization/c0088

    - title: Externalized c0089-task-main.yml reference
      filelookup: c0089-task-main.yml

    - title: Demo
      log: yes
