notes:
  goal:
    - to test using a simpler mode of data structure for tasks using array
  why:
    - array will allow you to put more attribute so that you can put desc

tasks:
  -
    name: task
    desc: this is task
    task: #this comment will not be treated as desc of the task, removing # will invalid the yml
      -
        func: shell
        desc: do step1 in shell func
        flags:
          - ignore_error
        do:
          - echo "hello"
          - echo "world"
          - echo "world"|grep non-exist
