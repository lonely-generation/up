notes:
  goal: to test using a simpler model of data structure for tasks using array
  why: array will allow you to put more attribute so that you can put desc

tasks:
  -
    name: task
    desc: say hello world in shell
    task: #this comment will not be treated as desc of the task, removing # will invalid the yml
      -
        func: shell
        desc: do step1 in shell func
        do:
          - echo "hello"
          - echo "world"
