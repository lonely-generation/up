goal:
  - to test out dvars rendering in scope
  - it loads global vars first, then render dvars and merge it with vars in global scope
  - it then merge nonprod vars to global as runtimevars, then
  - render dvars based on runtimevars, then
  - continue same idea down to individual runtime intance vars/dvars process

expected:
  1-6: all rendered with value
  7-8: |
    prod is not within the instance(dev)'s group, so it is correct
    that school_prod is not a living var hence no value
