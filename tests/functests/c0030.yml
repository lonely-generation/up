  head: |
    Demo a little more complex case with object merging in scope and externalizing settings to file

  sections:

    - title: d0030_school.yml reference
      filelookup: d0030_school.yml

    - title: Test result
      content: |
        prod is not within the instance(dev)'s group, so it is correct
        that school_prod is can not be rendered a value

    - title: Demo
      log: yes

notes:
  expected:
    1-6: all rendered with value
    7-8: |
      prod is not within the instance(dev)'s group, so it is correct
      that school_prod is not a living var hence no value
