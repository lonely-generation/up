  title: Exit result per step
  head: |
    note that for one step, there will be only one return, which will be the last line in do cmd in this case. Since the step3 exit code is 0 the whole step will have the return code of 0 if you need to use the exit code of the step you need to consider to reduce the number of do cmds or put it to last step, this is not a bug this is a feature

      log: yes


notes:
  not_a_bug:
    given:
      - the middel step fails
      - no ignoreError present
    expect:
      - it should fail and return the error code
      - it should not progress to the next step
