TODO:
  - not clear if dvar in calleed should be overriden as well??
  - need a review on this later on

doc_meta: |
  folder: dvars
  title: dvars in call
  head: |
    Demo dvars merge in local scope in execution time

  sections:
    - title: Note
      content: |
        * school object in callee

    - title: Demo
      log: yes

notes:
  goal:
    - dvars expand in call level
    - dvars object can merge in leaf level
    - dvar in call task will override same name dvar in local level

  expected:
    - school object in nonprod could append new element and
    - also override same name element
