notes:
  - add finally support to tasks level

tasks:

  -
    name: task
    task:

      -
        func: call
        desc: task
        do:
          - sub_task_layer1

  -
    name: sub_task_layer1
    desc: sub_task_layer1
    task:

      -
        func: call
        loop:
          - item1
          - item2
        do:
          - sub_task_layer2

  -
    name: sub_task_layer2
    task:

      -
        func: shell
        name: step1
        desc: step 1
        do:
          - 'echo """opening file: {{.loopitem}}"""'
          - echo "hello"|grep "world"

      -
        func: cmd
        name: step2
        desc: |
          in this case, since there is no ignoreError, the exception was captured by task level finaly code block
          opened file is safely closed
          to make the flow to continue to reach step2, use ignoreError
        do:
          - name: print
            cmd: step 2

    desc: |
      without rescue, the execution will return a non-zero  return code in shell and also report the error
      with rescue, the program will return 0
    rescue: true
    finally:
      -
        func: shell
        name: close_file
        desc: |
          ensure the opened file is closed
        do:
          - echo "close the file ....."
