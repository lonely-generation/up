  title: use block
  head: |
    Block func is introduced for an alternative coding style to mainly deal with internal business. Call func mainly serves to offer interoperability and sharing and exchanging code with different projects/teams, block func in the oposite, it allows your code to share the same vars stack as long as your func is in one of the leave level in tree of a block

  sections:
    - title: Vars inherit from block func vars and auto merge
      content: |
        Please notice that the values printed out in print cmd in the flow of steps in block func, the vars: a, b, da, db will inherit the values defined in vars in block func

    - title: Demo
      log: yes

notes:
  goal:
    - add feature to support block code style
