  title: finally in subtask level
  head: |
    Showcases that you can use finally block to do clean up in more complex sub task level

  sections:
    - title: Demo
      log: yes

    - title: What's the difference betwee the step level and task level finally cleanup and rescue?
      content: |
        The only difference would be that in the step level, you would be able to obtain the exec result and then conditionally do something about it

    task:

        func: call
        desc: |
          expect sub_task to close file each time in loop iteration
        loop:
          - 1
          - 2
        do:
          - sub_task

      -
        func: shell
        name: step1
        desc: step 1
        do:
          - echo "opening file"
          - echo "hello"|grep "world"
        flags: [ignoreError]

      -
        func: cmd
        name: step2
        desc: |
          in this case, since there is no ignoreError, the exception was captured by task level finaly code block
          opened file is safely closed
          to make the flow to continue to reach step2, use ignoreError
        do:
          - name: print
            cmd: step 2

    desc: |
      without rescue, the execution will return a non-zero  return code in shell and also report the error
      with rescue, the program will return 0
    rescue: true
    finally:
      -
        func: shell
        name: close_file
        desc: |
          ensure the opened file is closed
        do:
          - echo "close the file ....."
