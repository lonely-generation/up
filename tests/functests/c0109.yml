  sections:
    - title: Demo
      log: yes


notes:
  goal:
    - to test out the task vars dealing in sub task is all correct and expected

vars:
  tom: this is tom

tasks:
  -
    name: task
    task:
      -
        func: cmd
        dvars:
          - name: jerry
            value: this is jerry in task scope
            flags:
              - taskScope
        do:
          - name: print
            desc: this should print out the dvar value of jerry
            cmd: '{{.jerry}}'

      -
        func: call
        do:
          - subtask1

  -
    name: subtask1
    task:
      -
        func: cmd
        do:
          - name: print
            desc: this should print out the dvar value of jerry as it is declared jerry is in taskScope
            cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
          - name: trace
            cmd: ===>

      -
        func: cmd
        vars:
          jerry: jerry is overriden in local scope
        do:
          - name: print
            desc: |
              remember that the caller's vars should override callee's vars
              so jerry's value should the one from caller instead this local value
            cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
          - name: trace
            cmd: <===

          - name: trace
            cmd: --->

      -
        func: cmd
        do:
          - name: print
            desc: this should print out the jerry defined in caller's task var scope
            cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
          - name: trace
            cmd: <---
