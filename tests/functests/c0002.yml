  head: A task could be a sequential steps of implementation of a func. You can chaine a series of steps in a task

  sections:
    - title: Brief of shell func
      content: |
        A shell func is a func implementation, in which you could add one or multiple line of shell scripts to be executed

        We will call the step in the array of steps shell func as sub step to just avoid confusion, each func implementation in a task is called a step

    - title: ignore_error flag
      content: |
        A flag in flag list attaching to a func dictates some behavior, in such a way it provides additional feature to the execution, workflow etc

        Normally a successful shell execution returns exit code 0, ignore_error is to allow the executio to contiue to next or end without a return code of 0

        In this demo, it reports the sub step has failed with its own return code, but it continue to complete all execution
