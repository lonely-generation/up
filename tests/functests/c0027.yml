  title: convert dvar
  head: |
    A dvar value is normally a string, which could be a formated yml content, then be converted to an object. This demo shows that you can use a flag: to_object to notate this dvar will be transformed to an object and registered to global runtime

  sections:
    - title: Rules
      content: |
        * you can reference to plain dvar with the string|untemplated value
        * you can reference to hiera structure of a object once it is converted
        * the new name of the dvar object will be: dvar_object
        * the flag keep_name makes the dvar keep its original name as is instead of creating dvar_object
        * keep_name only used and pair to to_object

      log: yes

notes:
  goal:
    - to show complex object using dynamic var

  design:
    - register the object into that scope's vars list
    - consider a modified name of -> a_smart_guy_object to reference to

  expect:
    - you can reference to plain dvar with the string|untemplated value
    - you can reference to hiera structure of a object in static vars
    - you can reference to a dynamic converted dvar with new name -> a_smart_guy_object
    - fail if expand > 1 and to_object both exist

vars:
  student:
    name: Tom
    gender: Male
    address:
      suburb:
        name: sydney
        postcode: 2000
        CBD: yes
      school: Sydney Grammar


dvars:
  - name: a_smart_guy
    value: |
      name: Tom
      gender: Male
      school: Sydney Grammar
    flags: [to_object,]
#    expand: 2

  - name: school_address
    desc: |
      it can reference to the dvar object a_smart_guy_object has been registered from last step
    value: |
      address:
        suburb:
          name: {{.student.address.suburb.name}}
          postcode: 2000
          CBD: yes
        school: {{.student.address.school}}
        tom:
          name: {{.a_smart_guy_object.name}}
    flags: [to_object,]

  - name: tom
    desc: |
      in this case, we use keep_name flag to make the dvar name the same name we give. So instead we have regitered tom (yml string) and tom_object (object), we now only have tom as registered object
    value: |
      name: {{.a_smart_guy_object.name}}
      gender: Male
