  title: convert dvar
  head: |
    A dvar value is normally a string, which could be a formated yml content, then be converted to an object. This demo shows that you can use a flag: to_object to notate this dvar will be transformed to an object and registered to global runtime

  sections:
    - title: Rules
      content: |
        * you can reference to plain dvar with the string|untemplated value
        * you can reference to hiera structure of a object once it is converted
        * the new name of the dvar object will be: dvar_object

    - title: Demo
      log: yes

notes:
  goal:
    - to show complex object using dynamic var

  design:
    - register the object into that scope's vars list
    - consider a modified name of -> a_smart_guy_object to reference to

  expect:
    - you can reference to plain dvar with the string|untemplated value
    - you can reference to hiera structure of a object in static vars
    - you can reference to a dynamic converted dvar with new name -> a_smart_guy_object
    - fail if expand > 1 and to_object both exist
