notes:
  goal:
    - to show a design pattern using call and callee task without local vars
    - the caller's varss should always take priority than the the callee's vars, if callee has already got same local vars defined, they will be overrided and used as default values

vars:
  school: sydney grammar

tasks:
  -
    name: task
    task:
      -
        func: call
        desc: call function with different vars
        vars:
          studentname: Tom
          school: sydney grammar
          gender: male
        do:
          - function

  - name: function
    desc: |
      as a design pattern, this is a function task
      it's better to not to use any local vars, in this
      way, the vars are passed in from caller call so
      that this function could be used by multiple ref tasks
    task:
      -
        func: shell
        desc: show school and student info
        do:
          - echo "studentname -> {{.studentname}} | gender -> {{.gender}}"
          - echo "school -> {{.school}}"
