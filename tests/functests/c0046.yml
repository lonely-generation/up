goal:
  - showcase the bare minimal entry point is just a named task only
  - showcase how to gracefully manage the env vars

storys:
  - a cli script requires 2 input from env vars
  - |
    it also requires 2 config vars in a profile
    based config for different execution context/env,
    eg dev/st/prod
  - it should take the env var from current bash/shell environment
  - the env vars:
      student_name: |
        if it can not find it, it fails fast and execution stops
        ref to f0045 for the failed case
      student_age: if it can not find it, defaul it to 18


scopes:

  - name: global
    dvars:
      - name: student_name
        value: '{{ env "STUDENT_NAME" |default "Tom Hanks" }}'
      - name: student_age
        value: '{{ env "STUDENT_AGE" |default 28 }}'

dvars:
  - name: cli
