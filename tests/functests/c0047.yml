goal:
  - showcase the bare minimal entry point is just a named task only
  - showcase how to gracefully manage the env vars
  - continue of c0046

storys:
  - a cli script requires 2 input from env vars
  - it should take the env var from current bash/shell environment
  - the env vars:
      student_name: |
        if it can not find it, it fails fast and execution stops
        ref to f0045 for the failed case
      student_age: if it can not find it, defaul it to 18

scopes:

  - name: global
    dvars:
      - name: student_name
        value: '{{ env "STUDENT_NAME" |default "Tom Hanks" }}'
      - name: student_age
        value: '{{ env "STUDENT_AGE" |default 28 }}'

dvars:
  - name: cli
    desc: |
      you can offload this lengthy value to a ref file instead
      eventually the file will become a template file
    value: |
      echo """
      student details:
      name: {{.student_name}}
      age: {{.student_age}}
      """

tasks:

  -
    name: task
    task:
      - func: shell
        do:
          - '{{.cli}}'
