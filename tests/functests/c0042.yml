    You can use template func reg to register a value to global runtime or dereg to remove it from runtime

  sections:
    - title: Important note
      content: |
        Please note that the reg will register the value into global runtime, however this value will be only availble in the next func call

        Actually if you use a dvar value to register a value, the dvar actually does not do its core job to render value, so to make your runtime vars list clean, it better to use void as the dvar name, it will not create a new var and put into global runtime

        You can always use void as the name of a dvar, so that the dvar is used more like action method to do things rather than rendering value

      log: yes

notes:
  goal:
    - add feature to use .last_result to have a quick shortcut access to last task result

tasks:

  -
    name: task
    desc: test the exit scenarios due to different types of validation
    task:
      -
        func: shell
        desc: step1
        do:
          - echo tom
          - echo hanks

      -
        func: shell
        desc: |
          the last result of hanks will be registered as varname: hellomsg
          however this will be availabe at the next step
          as when it enters this step, it has already got a copied immutable var stack
        dvars:
          - name: reg_hello
            value: |
              hello: {{.last_result.Output |reg "hellomsg" }}
        do:
          - echo "{{.hellomsg}}"

      -
        func: shell
        desc: |
          the hellomsg will be still availabe in this step
          it is removed but will be unavailabe in the next step
        dvars:
          - name: reg_hello
            value: |
              {{dereg "hellomsg" }}
        do:
          - echo "{{.hellomsg}}"

      -
        func: shell
        desc: |
          now the hellomsg should be <no value>
        do:
          - echo "{{.hellomsg}}"

      -
        func: shell
        dvars:
          - name: void
            desc: |
              now this var name will not be shown in local automatically
              or in global if you register it as it the reg template func
              is more like a action and return sensible value
            value: 'hello: {{ print "something" |reg "iamvoid" }}'
            flags: [vvv]
        do:
          - echo '{{.iamvoid}}'

      -
        func: shell
        do:
          - echo '{{.iamvoid}}'
