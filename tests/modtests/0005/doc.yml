        In this demo, the vars are processed exactly same way like a internal caller func invoke a callee task

        So, at the entry point of the call func, it has assembled a list of execution vars. When these vars passed to callee func, these vars will firstly override callee's globle runtime vars, then override callee's local vars

        The magic here is that the caller func carries external vars to influence callee's behavior, while callee still derives all necessary settings from its global runtime vars(inclding group scope vars)
