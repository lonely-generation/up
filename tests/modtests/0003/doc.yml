        In this demo, the var b from module is returned to caller

        Pleas note that the two vars used in Say_world will produce the result based on the input, the var a is passed in from external caller and overriden. This is a design pattern of IOC - inverse of controll, a feature to allow consumer code to inject data to module, and the module will focus on detailed implementation
